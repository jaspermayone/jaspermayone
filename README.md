# About Me
💡 I like working on projects with topics such as Ai, Machine learning, and App Development.

🌱 I'd love to get deeper into Machine Learning and Ai. If you have any suggestions, Please open an issue on this repo.
 
✍️ In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, playing games with my family, and Snuggling with my cats.

💬 Feel free to reach out to me for Video, Photo, and Audio Editing, Drone Photography, and coding projects.

✉️ You can contact me by opening an issue in this repo, or emailing [jasper.mayone@singlefeather.com](mailto:jasper.mayone@singlefeather.com)! I'll try to respond as soon as I can.
