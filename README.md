While in high school, Jasper led a Hack Club at his school. Jasper tries to live by the quote “We’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on...that’s who we really are.” from one of his favorite books, Harry Potter. Jasper’s hobbies include reading, being in the great outdoors, photography, computer programming, cooking, and running away to join the circus.
