# Jasper Mayone (he/they)

Jasper Mayone is a 18-year-old post high school graduate from rural Vermont. They are a circus performer, a coder, and a photographer.

A circus artist and a native Vermonter, Jasper is a high school graduate from the class of 2024! Having completed high school in just 3 years, they are currently taking a gap year to explore. Jasper tries to live by the quote “We’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on...that’s who we really are.” from one of their favorite books, Harry Potter. Jasper’s hobbies include reading, being in the great outdoors, photography, computer programming, cooking, and running away to join the circus.
